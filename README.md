# Wildcards

This is my softball team's site app.  This will be a way for the Wildcards members to be able to see the weekly schedule, see their team and personal statistics and upload videos/images and communicate.  Currently on hold as I complete my studies at Bitmaker but will have it done so it can be used for 2016 softball season.

I am planning to have the site replace the html/css landing page that is currently on gowildcards.com
